# COVID-Twitter Multi-Label Classification üöÄ  
Analyzing and classifying public health messages on COVID-19 from Twitter using state-of-the-art NLP techniques and models.  

---

## üìú Project Overview  
This project focuses on classifying COVID-19-related tweets into multiple public health categories such as prevention, symptoms, outbreak, vaccines, and travel updates. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and techniques, this work contributes to real-time public health monitoring and the dissemination of critical information.

## ‚ú® Key Features  
- **Multi-Label Classification**: Developed pipelines to categorize tweets into multiple overlapping public health themes.  
- **State-of-the-Art Models**: 
  - **BERT** for contextual embeddings.  
  - **CNN-GRU**, **TCN**, and ensemble approaches for sequence modeling.  
- **Imbalanced Data Handling**: 
  - Implemented strategies like stratified sampling and weighted class adjustments to improve performance.  
  - Used TF-IDF with SVM as a baseline for comparison.  
- **Performance**: Achieved:  
  - **F1 score of 0.88** for binary classification.  
  - **F1 score of 0.76** for multi-label classification tasks.

## üìä Dataset  
- **Source**: Tweets collected from verified public health Twitter accounts such as `@CDCgov`, `@CDCemergency`, and others using the Tweepy API.  
- **Timeframe**: December 25, 2020 ‚Äì April 1, 2021.  
- **Annotations**: 
  - Binary labels indicating whether tweets are related to COVID-19.  
  - Five detailed categories for multi-label classification:  
    - Prevention  
    - Symptoms  
    - Outbreak  
    - Vaccines  
    - Travel
